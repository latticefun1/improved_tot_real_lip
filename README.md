A repo for our modified algorithm of [Module-LIP on GitLab (Inria)](https://gitlab.inria.fr/capsule/code-for-module-lip), Our modified algorithm is added in the "congruence.sage" script.
 
We ran experiments on a cluster with an environment defined in the .sl file. The comparison was done on the same inputs for the original algorithm and the modified version.
the output file is results__267863.data31.4294967294.out
